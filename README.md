# Multiple_Disease_Prediction_System

I am thrilled to showcase my Multiple Disease Prediction System, a project that leverages the power of Machine Learning and Streamlit to predict various diseases, including:

🔹 Diabetes
🔹 Stroke
🔹 Heart Disease
🔹 COVID-19
🔹 Breast Cancer

🌟 Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit, making it interactive and easy to use.
Multiple Models: Utilized different trained ML models to provide disease-specific predictions.
Dynamic Navigation: Enabled seamless navigation for multiple disease predictions using the streamlit-option-menu.
💻 Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.
Streamlit: For creating a web-based interface.
Machine Learning Models: Trained using datasets tailored for each disease.
Pickle: For saving and loading trained models efficiently.
📈 Project Workflow:
1️⃣ Collected and preprocessed datasets for diseases from authentic sources.
2️⃣ Trained ML models for each disease.
3️⃣ Developed a web application to allow users to input data and receive predictions in real time.

Here’s a snippet of the functionalities:
👉 Diabetes Prediction: Predicts whether a person is diabetic based on health metrics.
👉 Stroke Prediction: Assesses the risk of a stroke.
👉 Heart Disease Prediction: Estimates the likelihood of heart-related issues.
👉 COVID-19 Prediction: Analyzes health data to predict severity.
👉 Breast Cancer Prediction: Identifies malignant or benign cases.

💡 Challenges Overcome:

Integrating multiple ML models seamlessly into a single application.
Creating a user-friendly interface despite varying input features for each prediction.

This project has been an incredible learning experience, helping me enhance my skills in ML, Python, and application deployment. I am looking forward to using these skills in real-world applications and contributing to impactful projects!
